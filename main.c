/*the first couple of hours of lab 1 were spent understanding and simplifying the
dense brief for the assessment task. Beyond that, research was taken into the types of ciphers
and pseudocode was begun. This is why this initial commit does not contain much code*/

/* resolved confusion regarding e(x) = (m + k) mod 26, recognizing it does not multiply by the modulus but
this is a simplified way of stating that the value needs to be tested and adjusted if it falls outside the range
of 0 and 25. Additionally studied lecture content and wrote pseudocode for an array, using a pointer to an element,
adding the key to it, and the incrementing the pointer to the next element, exiting at the end of the array */
